Tutorial Taken From: 
https://dev.to/franciscomendes10866/how-to-validate-data-in-golang-1f87?fbclid=IwAR1UPTJcz90pfZVNO5eoreD-thL91ZnD-A35YCBB-2dHGcKftqEhFdMQdso


Lessons Learned: 
- Used 2 new go lang packages gofiber/fiber and go go-playground/validator
  * Fiber is a lot like Express from Node so I like it quite a bit and may want to continue down this road
  * The validation really made me use the type {SomeObject} struct format of Go
  * A revisit of validating user input and why we do it 
  * I still have so much to learn in the Go Ecosystem....
